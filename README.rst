Pallas – AWS Athena client
==========================

Pallas makes querying AWS Athena easy.

It is especially valuable for analyses in Jupyter Notebook,
but it is designed to be generic and usable in any application.


Main features:

* Friendly interface to AWS Athena.
* Performance – Large results are downloaded directly from S3,
  which is much faster than using Athena API.
* Pandas integration - Results can be converted to Pandas DataFrame
  with correct data types mapped automatically.
* Local caching – Query results can be cached locally,
  so no data have to be downloaded when a Jupyter notebook is restarted.
* Remote caching – Query IDs can be cached in S3,
  so team mates can reproduce results without incurring additional costs.
* Fixes malformed results returned by Athena to DCL
  (for example DESCRIBE) queries.
* Optional white space normalization for better caching.
* Kills queries on KeyboardInterrupt.
