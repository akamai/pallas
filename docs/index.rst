Pallas documentation
====================

Pallas makes querying AWS Athena easy.

It is especially valuable for analyses in Jupyter Notebook,
but it is designed to be generic and usable in any application.


Main features:

* Friendly interface to AWS Athena.
* Caching - local and remote cache for reproducible results.
* Performance â€“ Large results are downloaded from S3.
* Pandas integration - Conversion to DataFrame with appropriate dtypes.
* Optional white space normalization for better caching.
* Kills queries on KeyboardInterrupt.


.. code-block:: python

    import pallas
    athena = pallas.environ_setup()
    df = athena.execute("SELECT 'Hello world!'").to_df()
